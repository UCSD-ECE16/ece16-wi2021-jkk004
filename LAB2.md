Challenge 1:
I made a folder with all the videos due to my gifs being too short when optimized and too large if they arent https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yH_9qMzIOthvwkxRodfma5dTTTnqHjkb?usp=sharing 

In my code, I used the reading of 2000 because I noticed that that was about where the graph peaked when it got tapped. This way may be unconventional, but it got the job done. I added a delay of 1100 whenever it was tapped because if I didn't, every tap would add like 10 to the number of taps
