I put a lot of work in making the code

-I had trouble with Pyenchant working because it failed to even import it, like many others. However, if it were to work, I would have implemented like so in my code. Also, Ill post code that worked for me 90 percent of the time. Words like chair, protect, etc didnt work because there were two consonants in front of the vowel
-However, my code never fails when converting to pig latin, just converting from pig latin to english it fails sometimes
