I put a lot of work in making the code

-I had trouble with Pyenchant working because it failed to even import it, like many others. However, if it were to work, I would have implemented like so in my code. Ill post another which works most of the times but doesnt work when the word is like "Protect", "chair", or words with two consonants in front of the vowel.
